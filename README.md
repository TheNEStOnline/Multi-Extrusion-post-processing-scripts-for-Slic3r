# Multi-Extrusion post-processing scripts for Slic3r
useful postprocessing scripts for Slic3r for adding wipe towers and other multi-extrusion features. Written in Perl.
![example g-code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheNEStOnline/Multi-Extrusion-post-processing-scripts-for-Slic3r/6c7a91dbf7c16d14acc304833537346e233451eb/Example_Images/2_Color_Dice.png)
## Available scripts
### wipe_towers_tc.pl
- adding wipe towers
- resorting print order to a sequential build for finest results
- highly configurable

## Changelog
### to do
- [ ] add compatibility for relative coordinate mode
- [ ] add compatibility for absolute extrusion mode
- [ ] Slic3r environment variables cannot be read, therefore settings and parameters have to be manually declared within the custom "Start G-code"
- [ ] add workaround for Slic3rs lack of retraction on print start for inactive extruders

### v1
- [x] scripts are tested and working
- [x] printing results are spotless and really awesome
- [x] compatible to absolute coordinate mode
- [x] compatible to relative extrusion mode

### v2
- [x] some bugfixes, including support for >2 extruders, suggested by PxT (thx!!)
- [x] added optional parameter "forceToolChanges", defaults to true
- [x] travelLifts now happen in both directions

## How to use
In order to get the scripts working properly, I suggest creating print and printer settings in slic3r exclusively for use with those scripts, and modifying these settings as described below.

### Installation
Copy the scripts to a directory of your choice, note that directory.

### In the print settings:
Add the full path to the script as noted above in the _Print Settings -> Output options -> Post-processing scripts_ field
I suggest only using one post-processing Script at a time.

### In the printer settings:
1. Tick "Use relative E distances" in Printer Settings -> General

2. In _Printer Settings -> Custom G-Code_, add the following to the very beginning of your "Start G-code", your own custom Start G-code can follow after that:
```
; WIPE TOWER PARAMS
; forceToolChanges=true
; nozzleDiameter=[nozzle_diameter]
; filamentDiameter=[filament_diameter]
; extrusionWidth=[extrusion_width]
; layerHeight=[layer_height]
; firstLayerHeight=[first_layer_height]
; extrusionMultiplier=[extrusion_multiplier]
; firstLayerExtrusionMultiplier=4
; retractionLength=[retract_length]
; toolChangeRetractionLength=[retract_length_toolchange]
; bedWidth=[bed_size_X]
; bedDepth=[bed_size_Y]
; extruders=2
; wipeTowerX=80
; wipeTowerY=155
; wipeTowerW=10
; wipeTowerH=10
; wipeTowerSpacing=20
; wipeTowerLoops=5
; wipeTowerBrimLoops=7
; wipeOffset=2
; purgeOffset=1.33
; wipeLift=5
; travelLift=1
; purgeAmount=0.5
; retractionFeedrate=[retract_speed]
; travelFeedrate=[travel_speed]
; printFeedrate=[perimeter_speed]
; extrusionFeedrate=25
```

3. Also, add the following line to the very beginning of your "End G-Code", your own custom End G-Code can follow
```
; end of g-code
```

4. The "After layer change G-code" should consist of exactly that line:
```
; next layer
```

5. The "Tool change G-code" should consist of exactly that line:
```
; tool change
```

I've never written a line of Perl before this project. I'm still learning, but also had to make this work. Any suggestions are heavily welcome.
